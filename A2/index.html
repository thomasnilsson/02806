		<h2>Part 1: Telling Data Stories</h2>
		<h5><i>The questions below refer to <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Narrative-InfoVis.pdf">Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer.
			Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data</a></i></h4>

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q1: What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?</i></h5>
			<i>The Oxford English Dictionary defines narrative as a form of account of series of events or facts, 
				establishing a connection and order between them. 
				Generally, narrative would consist of introduction, series of events and resolution at the end.</i>

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q2: What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3?</i></h5>
			Figure 2; The visualization displays how financial forecasting based on previous performance rarely works out in the real world, 
			which can be seen from how the annual trajectories most of the time are wrong in their predictions. 
			The visualization not only presents the plot, but also explains the reasons standing behind the data. 
			Moreover, user can interact with the visualization by revealing details-on-demand with the years and estimates of past forecasts. 
			All those features makes user more involved in understanding and analysing the phenomena described by the visualization. 


			<h5 class="question"><i>Q3: What's the point of Figure 7?</i></h5>
			Figure 7 gives an overview of visualization strategies used in popular media, coupling the genre of visualisation 
			with different choices of visual narratives and narrative structures and makes it easy to identify the most common 
			choices of visual narratives and narrative structures among genres. Design Space Analysis allows to notice patterns 
			standing out from the data. In this particular case, three main patterns have been identified: (1) the clustering of 
			different ordering structures, (2) the consistency of interaction design and (3) the under-utilization of narrative messaging.


			<h5 class="question"><i>Q4: Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure.</i></h5>
			<b>Visual Narrative:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Visual Structuring: Consistent visual platform (34) </li>
				<li>Highlighting: Feature distinction (46)</li>
				<li>Transition Guidance: Familiar objects (18) & Animated transitions (20) </li>
			</ul>
			
			<b>Narrative Structure:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Ordering: User directed path (31)</li>
				<li>Interactivity: Filtering (38), Very limited interactivity (35), Hover (34), Explicit instruction (30)</li>
				<li>Messaging: Captions/headlines (49)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5 class="question"><i>Q5: What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why?</i></h5>
			<p>It is difficult to choose the most and least favorite genre of narrative visualization, since the optimal choice of genre 
				depends on what kind of data is supposed to be presented, as well as what the author is trying to communicate. 
				Genre of narrative visualization should be always picked based on the complexity of the data, the complexity of the story, 
				the intended audience and the intended medium.</p>

			<p><b>Slideshows</b> allows the author to partition the information into separate slides, in order to make the information more digestible, 
				i.e. by allowing the reader to go through the information at their own pace. It is easy to move back and forth thanks to the inherent 
				sectioning of a slide show. </p>
			
			<p><b>The annotated chart</b> chart can work very well for showing trajectories such as observations related to climate change, 
				where annotations may point out events of significance during a time series, such as the industrial revolution. 
				It can also be used to point out how trajectories are unreliable as is the case in Figure 2.</p>

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q6: What is your least favorite genre? Why?</i></h5>
			Magazine style; The example given requires the reader to read a large amount of text, which is ideally what the visualisation should convey by itself. 
			The main disadvantage of the magazine style is the fact that it does not allow interactive exploration, 
			which would help user to understand the data faster and get more involved in the exploration process.
