		<h2>Part 1: Telling Data Stories</h2>
		<h4><i>The questions below refer to Edward Segel and Jeffrey Heer.
			Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data</i></h4>

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q1: What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?</i></h5>
			<i>“An account of a series of events, facts, etc given in order and with the establishment of a connection between them.”</i>

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q2: What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3?</i></h5>
			Figure 2; The visualization displays an interesting concept which is that forecasting based on previous performance rarely works out in the real world, 
			which can be seen from how the annual trajectories most of the time are wrong in their predictions.

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q3: What's the point of Figure 7?</i></h5>
			Figure 7 gives an overview of visualization strategies used in popular media, coupling the genre of visualisation 
			with different choices of visual narratives and narrative structures and makes it easy to identify the most common 
			choices of visual narratives and narrative structures among genres.


			<h5 class="question"><i>Q4: Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure</i></h5>
			<b>Visual Narrative:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Visual Structuring: Consistent visual platform (34) </li>
				<li>Highlighting: Feature distinction (46)</li>
				<li>Transition Guidance: Familiar objects (18) & Animated transitions (20) </li>
			</ul>
			
			<b>Narrative Structure:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Ordering: User directed path (31)</li>
				<li>Interactivity: Filtering (38), Very limited interactivity (35), Hover (34), Explicit instruction (30)</li>
				<li>Messaging: Captions/headlines (49)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5 class="question"><i>Q5: What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why?</i></h5>
			<p>It is difficult to choose because the optimal choice of genre obviously depends on what you are trying to communicate and what data you have available. 
					The same goes for least favorite genre.</p>

			<p><b>Slideshows</b> allows the author to partition the information into separate slides in order to make the information more digestible, 
				i.e. by allowing the reader to go through the information at their own pace. 
				It is easy to move back and forth because of the inherent sectioning of a slide show. </p>
			
			<p><b>The annotated chart</b> can work very for showing trajectories such as observations related to climate change where annotations 
				may point out events of significance during a time series, such as the industrial revolution. 
				It can also be used to point out how trajectories are unreliable as is the case in Figure 2.</p>

			<h5 class="question"><i>Q6: What is your least favorite genre? Why?</i></h5>
			Magazine style; The example given requires the reader to read a large amount of text, which is ideally what the visualisation should convey by itself
