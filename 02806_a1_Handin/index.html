		<h2 align="center">Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>

		<p><b>Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.</b></p>
		<p>A jitter plot makes it possible to visualize data points, which would otherwise be overlapping. As a consequence, we are able to observe clusters of data, which are characterized by a higher density of data points.</p>

		<p><b>Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward, but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).</b></p>
		<p>This plot shows us how important the choice of anchoring point for the first bin is. Even though both plots have the same bin width, the bin alignment is different. A wise choice leads to meaningful visualizations of data, showing the actual data distribution. (Loss of information the other way around)</p>

		<p><b>The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?</b></p>
		<p>In some cases KDEs can be misleading. The reason for that could be wrongly chosen bandwidth. If it is too high, we lose important details about the data. On the other hand, if it is too low, it can be hard to find overall pattern, since the resulting curve is too wiggly. This is called a bias-variance trade-off. The optimal bandwidth is a property of the dataset and results in the most informative and true visualization of the dataset. </p>

		<p><b>I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?</b></p>
		<p>The CDF is less intuitive because it is cumulative. As a consequence, an exact value for one argument is easy to find only for the first one. Further parts of the plot is a sum of previous values, so it is hard for us to find values of specific arguments. On the other hand, a CDF often answers the questions that we are looking for when visualizing a dataset straight away without any computation, such as what proportion of the data are above or below some value. </p>

		<p><b>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for?</b></p>
		<p>Quantile plots are similar to CDF plots. The only difference is that it is inverted (x and y axes have been switched). It is easier to answer questions such as:  ‘what is the value of x for the 10th percentile of y?</p>

		<p><b>How is a Probability plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</b></p>
		<p>Probability plot is a graphical technique for comparing two data sets using distribution, either two sets of empirical observations, or one empirical set against a theoretical set. Probability plot can be used for comparison between observed data with truth data, or observed with predicted data. Moreover, the probability plot allows to figure out whether the dataset follows a gaussian distribution. Yes, we have seen one before. Probability plots are very popular in field of machine learning.</p>

		<p><b>One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better.</b></p>
		<p>If it is suspected that the data distribution is symmetric and doesn’t have important outliers, then tools like mean or standard deviation could be a right choice. However, when the data distribution is skewed (which often happens) and there could be some outlier, the median and percentile should be used. It is important to see the outliers, and the whole distribution of data. Mean and median in many cases  are hiding some relevant information.</p>

		<p><b>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</b></p>
		<p>Box plots are the most useful, when we need to see the distribution of all the data, as well as specific information on outliers presence. Box plots are very useful to compare several distributions against one another.</p>

		<p><b>The book doesn't mention violin plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?</b></p>
		<p>The violin plots, apart from everything that box plots shows, also provides probability density. Extra information included in the plot may result in better understanding of the data.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Part 2: DAOST Chapter 3 Questions</h2>

		<p><b>Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?</b></p>
		<p>The data points are arranged nicely in a clearly visible pattern, there is no jitter in the way they are positioned, and there seems to be no outliers. If it had been a noisy dataset, then it might not even have been possible to discern a pattern.</p>

		<p><b>Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?</b></p>
		<p>In the plot in Fig 3-3, it seems that there must be another confounding variable that has not been controlled for. A real-world example could be if a naïve researcher plotted the Boston Marathon times for both men and women in the same graph thinking that gender was not a factor, which is of course a faulty assumption.</p>

		<p><b>What are the two methods Janert mentions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?</b></p>
		<p>Janert mentions weighted splines, and LOESS (LOWESS). Another method is Moving average where a series of averages are created from subsets of the data working from one end of the dataset to the other.</p>

		<p><b>What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?</b></p>
		<p>Residuals describe how far off the data points are from the smoothed curve. They should average to 0 irrespective of the point of the curve that is evaluated. A deviation from this (especially systematic) indicates that the chosen model is a bad fit. Visualizing the residuals makes it easy to spot systematic deviations from 0.</p>

		<p><b>Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.</b></p>
		<p>A smooth tube is created by first considering a weight factor for each data point that puts less importance on outliers. This is applied to the smoothed curve calculations for the data points giving rise to negative and positive residuals separately, and results in a smoothed curve above and below the smoothed curve for the full dataset (without weighting). The positive and negative curves should be at a more or less constant distance from the central line and can also be viewed as confidence bands that indicate how far off from the original smoothed curve the data points are likely to be.</p>

		<p><b>What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?</b></p>
		<p>An exponential relationship between x and y, where the variable x is the exponent.</p>

		<p><b>What kind of functions will loglog plots help you see?</b></p>
		<p>A power law-relationship where the variable, x, is in the base.</p>

		<p><b>What the h#ll is banking and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?</b></p>
		<p>Banking is a graphical method to adjust the aspect ratio so that most slopes are at an approximately 45 degree angle. E.g. by adjusting the axes. The human vision likes proportions of roughly 4 by 3 and banking means to accommodate this preference. Banking might, however, result in a loss of detail if applied too vigorously.</p>

		<p><b>I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it?</b></p>
		<p>The notion that a linear regression line is the best fit is misleading. The two variables are not interchangeable and linear regression is better thought of as a best predictor.</p>

		<p><b>Summarize the discussion of Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics on pp. 68-69 in your own words.</b></p>
		<p>The difference between Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics is that the purpose of the first one is to explore a dataset, while Presentation Graphics aim to present the important aspects of a dataset to others. Exploring a dataset graphically e..g means to create different plots to view the dataset from “different angles”. Presenting results from a data analysis means making the important points easily visible.</p>

		<p>As part of a homework assignment, I ask my students at Pratt to go out and chart something of interest to them, and <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fkvsavarese&amp;t=NmE2YmYyYjU4NTI3MTFhYWFiMWE1ZjFhNzc1NmUzMmE0ZDQ4OGM2NSwxeHM2a1phNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5jlxwUw4OZ-2SbgNDPgKMQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fiquantny.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F129373499164%2Fthis-is-quantifiably-the-best-month-to-go-to-the&amp;m=1">Katherine Savarese</a> came back with a simple chart about farmers markets that I loved- it inspired this post.</p>

		<p>You probably know that farmers markets are a staple across <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grownyc.org%2Ffiles%2Fgmkt%2Fmap.pdf&amp;t=MGM4YmRjZjQ2ZmFmYzBiYmMzMmY5NDU2MTdiNzMzMmYyOWQ5YjQ2ZSwxeHM2a1phNg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A5jlxwUw4OZ-2SbgNDPgKMQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fiquantny.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F129373499164%2Fthis-is-quantifiably-the-best-month-to-go-to-the&amp;m=1">all five boroughs</a> of New York City, but September happens to be a very special month.  Why is that?
		Well, it turns out September is the month with the most unique types of fresh produce- forty three to be exact.</p>

		<p>To show the current offerings, we charted how many types of fruits and vegetables are available by month, and showed if they were fresh or from storage.</p>

      	<div id="chartNY" style="border: 1px solid" align="center">
			<div class="tooltip" id="tooltip" class="hidden">
				<strong><p><span id="month"/></strong></p>
					<p>Types: <span id="count"/></p>
			</div>
		</div>

      <p>If you miss the month of September, you might be behind the fruit curve, but there are plenty more months of vegetables left. The chart shows that fresh vegetables are available 9 out of 12 months, but fruit is only available 5 out of 12. Now if only we could quantify how delicious the produce is...</p>
