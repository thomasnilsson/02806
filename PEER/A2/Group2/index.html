                        Part 1: Telling Data Stories
                    </h3>
                    <h4>What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?</h4>
                    The oxford english dictionary defines a narrative as:
                    <blockquote>“An account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections
                        between them.” </blockquote>
                    Essentially, it is a representation of a story where the representation is the order of which the events are related.
                    <h4>What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.</h4>
                    I enjoyed the visualization of
                    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/02/us/politics/20100201-budget-porcupine-graphic.html">
                        Budget Forecasts, Compared With Reality</a> by the New York Times. First of all, the visualization
                    guides the observer through the narrative using six slides. Each slide represents an important point
                    for the narrative, and keeps the observer interested. The graph is kept simple, and very consistent in
                    style and coloring. Compared to the other visualizations in the paper, it represents a manageable amount
                    of data, and hides the remaining data for the user to explore. Finally, the use of annotations is kept
                    to a bare minimum, but the ones provided helps explaining key points in the timeline.
                    <h4>What's the point of Figure 7?</h4>
                    Figure 7 presents an analysis of the design space of narrative visualization. This is useful for identifying recurring elements
                    in different visualizations, and categorizing these design features. The figure gives a complete overview
                    of the genres, visual narrative and narrative structures of all analysed visualizations. From the figure,
                    a clear distinction between each visualization can be made using these different patterns.
                    <h4>Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and
                        Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting',
                        etc).
                    </h4>
                    The most frequent design choices to create a visual narrative by the category (Visual Structuring, Highlighting and Transition Guidance) are;<br>Consistent Visual Platform, Feature Distinction and Onject Continuity. <br> <br>
                    The most frequent design choices to create a narrative structure by category (Ordering, Interactivity and Messaging) are;<br>User Directed Path, Filtiering/Selection/Search and Captions/Headlines.
                    <h4>Check out Figure 8 and section 4.3. What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why?</h4>
                    I find this question hard to answer, since most genres has their ups and downs and is very dependent on data. If I have to choose a visualization, I would go with a flow chart, since both simplistic and very complex dynamics can be visualized by flow charts.  
                    <h4>What is your least favorite genre? Why?</h4>
                    This is again dependent on data but a bit easier to answer, since I dislike the magazine style visualization. Text heavy visualizations tend to make me lose interest if I my attention to the topic is not already caught.

                    <p>
                        The purpose of this section is to visualize reported murders in New York City from 2006 to 2016, both geographically and
                        temporally. Two datasets were used:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                a dataset specifying the global coordinates of each of the five boroughs and their features, and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                a dataset specifying each reported murder for the period, including the date of the report, the hour of the day at which
                                the complaint was submitted, and the geographical location at which the murder allegedly
                                took place.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The visualization is showcased in figure 1. You are invited to interact with the visualization in the following ways:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Click and drag</strong> in the timeline to visualize murders for a subset of the period.
                                The vertical scale of the bar chart will update in accordance with the width of your current
                                selection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Click</strong> the timeline outside the selection (marked gray if present) to reset the selection
                                to the entire period.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Click</strong> the 'Animate' button to quickly visualize how the distribution of murders--
                                both in terms of location and time of day-- developed over the entire period. This part of
                                the visualization implies a decrease in the total number of murders with roughly the same
                                daily distribution (please see the bar chart on the right).
                            </li>
